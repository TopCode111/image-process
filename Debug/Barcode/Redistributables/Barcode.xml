            Code 128 barcode class. <seealso cref="T:Limilabs.Barcode.BarcodeEAN128" />
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This type of bar code is used mostly in the shipping industry and on labels. 
            This code is variable in length, alphanumeric, and continuous 
            where all spaces are part of the characters. 
            Each character consists of three bars and three spaces.
            This is a very compact, high density symbol. 
            Because of its high density it makes very efficient use of space. 
            Encoded characters include numbers, letters and special characters. 
            The checksum digit is included in all Code 128 Barcodes, but it isn't printed.

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Code 39 is the most popular bar code symbology used for ID, inventory, tracking and labeling.
            It can be read by most types of scanners. 
            Characters available for encoding include uppercase letters and numbers. 
            It is self checking but when additional security is required, a check character is an option. 
            It is the standard bar code used by the United States Department of Defense, 
            and is also used by the Health Industry Bar Code Council (HIBCC).

            UCC/EAN-128 encodes data and encodes what that data represents.

            EAN-13 barcode class. Also known as: EAN-99, JAN-13.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Implemented by the International Article Numbering Association (EAN) in Europe.
            EAN-13 is a superset of UPC-A. This means that any software or hardware capable 
            of reading an EAN-13 symbol will automatically be able to read an UPC-A symbol.
            <br /><br />
            Bookland bar codes are used on books and ISSN bar codes are used on magazines.
            <br /><br />
            The number of the item and its price are not actually in the bar code. 
            When the EAN bar code is scanned it pulls out information from an inventory database. 
            This is how the registers know the item name and price. 
            When prices change, they are changed in the database, 
            otherwise each item affected by the price change would have to have its bar code replaced.
            <br /><br />
            The EAN Symbol is numeric only. It is made up of the following: 
            <list type="bullet">
                <item>The number system, 2 or 3 digits. </item>
                <item>Manufacturer number, assigned by the Uniform Code Council. </item>
                <item>Product number that identifies the product, assigned by the manufacturer. </item>
                <item>A check character found in the lower right hand corner. </item>
            </list>
            <br /><br />
            EAN bar codes are used in Europe, 
            JAN (Japanese Article Numbering) bar codes are used in Japan, 
            UPC are used in the USA.
            <br /><br />
            EAN-99 is a special form of EAN-13 which just starts with "99".
            JAN-13 is a special form of EAN-13 which just starts with "45" or "49".

            It is used primarily in the distribution and warehouse industry and in the medical field.
            It is commonly used for ITF-14, EAN-14, SSC-14 and DUN14.
            <br/><br/>
            The code is variable in length and is numeric only. 
            It is also a continuous symbology. 
            <br/><br/>
            Each character consists of 5 bars and 5 spaces. 
            Each character encodes 2 digits. 
            The bars encode the odd digits, and the spaces encode the even digits.
            This is the highest density symbology for numeric data. 
            It is a self checking code but the use of a check character is optional if additional security is necessary.
            <br/><br/>
            Number length must be even. If number length is odd add '0' character at the beginning.

            UPC-A barcode class
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            UPC bar codes are used by the grocery and retail industries. 
            Supersets to UPC are EAN, Jan, Bookland and ISSN bar codes. 
            EAN bar codes are used in Europe and JAN bar codes are used in Japan. 
            Bookland bar codes are used on books and ISSN bar codes are used on magazines.
            
            The number of the item and its price are not actually in the bar code. 
            When the UPC bar code is scanned it pulls out information from an inventory database. 
            This is how the registers know the item name and price. 
            When prices change, they are changed in the database, 
            otherwise each item affected by the price change would have to have its bar code replaced.
            
            The UPC Symbol is numeric only. It is made up of the following: 
            <list type="bullet">
                <item>The number system, single digit in lower left corner. </item>
                <item>A 5 digit manufacturer number on the left, assigned by the Uniform Code Council. </item>
                <item>A 5 digit product number on the right that identifies the product, assigned by the manufacturer. </item>
                <item>A check character found in the lower right hand corner. </item>
